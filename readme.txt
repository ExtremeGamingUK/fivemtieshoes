Thank you for purchasing my shoe tie script <3
For more support dm me on discord ChickenNuggz#4051, i am active everyday

Simple copy and paste this into your server.cfg 'ensure tieshoes'
Edit the config to fit your server.

To add this to a radial menu or something alike, add these to your client file where you click the button
ExecuteCommand('tieshoes')
ExecuteCommand('untieshoes')
(obviously if you have changed the command names inside of the config, you those commands name in the above 2 lines of code)
